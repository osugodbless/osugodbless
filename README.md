## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Godbless Lucky Osu**

I'm a dynamic Cloud Engineer and DevOps enthusiast driven by a profound enthusiasm for harnessing technology to solve complex problems. I first became interested in tech when I took an introductory HTML & CSS course during my time as a molecular laboratory intern.

Driven by a relentless pursuit of professional growth, I enrolled in and graduated from a Cloud computing course, offered by the African Leadership Xcelerator (ALX), a company dedicated to delivering world-class tech training to millions of people in Africa. As a result, I am proud to hold the AWS Solutions Architect certification, a testament to my commitment to mastering cloud technologies. Currently, I am on a quest to gain more hands-on experience with various Cloud technologies, DevOps tools, and subsequently, achieve more certifications. This is to further solidify my expertise as a DevOps Engineer. Ultimately, I aim to optimize development and operations, enhance security measures, and drive scalable growth for businesses.

I am currently upskilling and eagerly await the opportunity to embark on my tech career, where I envision making a significant impact as a professional.
