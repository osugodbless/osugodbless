## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Godbless Lucky Osu**

I'm a curious and resilient individual with a passion for using technology to solve complex challenges like scalability, reliability, and security. I'm currently focused on backend development, building secure and efficient systems while leveraging cloud technologies. My ultimate goal is to grow into a DevOps role.

I also have a solid foundation in cloud computing and recently got Certified as an AWS Solutions Architect. I'm excited to learn, grow, and contribute to impactful projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently gaining hands-on experience in backend development with Python and building more proficiency with AWS Cloud tools.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend-related projects and Cloud Projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love networking, and outside of work, I love playing football and biking.
